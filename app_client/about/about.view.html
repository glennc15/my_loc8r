			<h1>myLoc8r</h1>

			<p>myLoc8r is my implementation of the Loc8r app built by Simon Holmes in his excellent book <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/getting-mean-with-mongo-express-angular-and-node">Getting MEAN with Mongo, Express, Angular, and Node</a>, 1st edition.</p>

			<p>MyLoc8r is a dynamic and user-friendly single-page application designed to help users discover the best <strong>FICTIONAL</strong> coffee shops and cafes with Wifi near their location. Using Geolocation data from the browser, MyLoc8r displays a list of nearby <strong>FICTIONAL</strong> coffee shops and cafes, complete with helpful filters to narrow down the search results by available facilities at each location.</p>

			<p>In addition to providing basic information about each location, MyLoc8r also offers in-depth details, such as reviews from other users, operating hours, map details, and a full list of onsite facilities. Users can easily create an account to leave their own reviews and ratings for their favorite <strong>FICTIONAL</strong> coffee shops and cafes, helping others in the community make informed decisions about where to go for their next caffeine fix.</p>

			<p>MyLoc8r is an excellent tool for coffee lovers who want to explore new <strong>FICTIONAL</strong> places and connect with other enthusiasts in their area. With its intuitive interface and comprehensive features, MyLoc8r makes finding and sharing great coffee experiences easier than ever before.</p>

			<p>My implementation differs from Simon's in the following ways:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>The back end API is build with <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/">Python Flask</a> instead of Node/Express</li>
				<li><a href="https://docs.mongoengine.org/">MongoEngine</a> is the Object-Document mapper.</li>
				<li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap 5</a> is the front end toolkit.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">Mapbox</a> is used instead of Google maps.</li>
				<li>Uses Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a> - Unit testing framework and <a href="https://pypi.org/project/requests/">Requests</a> for API testing.</li>
				<li>Uses Python <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html">unittest</a> - Unit testing framework and <a href="https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/">Selenium</a> for front end testing.</li>
